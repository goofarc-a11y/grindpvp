# GrindPvP Backend

FastAPI service for registered players, ranked kits, public verified-player
leaderboards, match history, and authenticated administration.

## Render deployment

The Render Blueprint is in `render.yaml` and is configured for the `backend`
directory. It creates a PostgreSQL database and web service. Set
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Render's environment settings before relying on admin
functions. The client signs in with the password only; the backend uses its
internal `admin` account by default. Passwords are scrypt-hashed before
storage, and failed login attempts are rate-limited per client IP. Configure
the desired password as a Render environment secret; do not put it in the
client or source code.

For an existing Render service, set:

- Root Directory: `backend`
- Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start Command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Health Check Path: `/health`
- `APP_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` to the Render PostgreSQL internal connection string
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to the password accepted by the password-only login form
- `CORS_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of exact trusted website origins
  (for example `https://grindpvp-website.onrender.com`). Do not use `*` for a
  public deployment. The local Vite development server proxies API requests.

Render deploys the source connected to its Git repository. Push these changes
to that repository or trigger a deploy after updating the source; changing
files in a local workspace does not modify an already running Render service.

## Local setup

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` to `sqlite:///./grindpvp.db` for local development or a
PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy URL for PostgreSQL. Admin login is disabled until
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set. Public self-registration is disabled
because a client-supplied UUID does not prove Minecraft account ownership; an
administrator can add the player by current Minecraft name. New names are
resolved to UUIDs through Mojang's official profile service; existing UUID
based admin requests remain supported. This lookup confirms the profile exists
but does not prove account ownership.

## API

- `GET /health`, `GET /catalog`
- `GET /players?search=&page=&page_size=`; `POST /players` is intentionally
  rejected until trusted Minecraft account verification is implemented
- `GET /players/{uuid}/stats`, `GET /profiles/{uuid}`
- `GET /players/presentation?page=&page_size=` returns name-decoration data
  for verified players only
- `GET /leaderboard/overall`, `GET /leaderboard/{kit}`
- `GET /matches`, `GET /matches/{uuid}`
- `POST /admin/login`, then pass the returned bearer token to admin endpoints
- `POST /admin/logout`, `/players`, `/verify`, `/roles`, `/titles`, `/matches`,
  `/tiers`, `/stats`; `GET /admin/matches`, `/logs`, `/players/{uuid}`

The browser website uses these same endpoints and the same configured database.
Set the backend's `CORS_ORIGINS` to the deployed website origin before using a
cross-origin production deployment.
The production health response reports `database_engine`; it must say
`postgresql`. Production startup now fails rather than silently accepting
SQLite, which prevents a misconfigured Render service from creating an
independent ephemeral player database.

Admin create, verify, role, title, tier, statistics, and match operations accept
Minecraft names. New player creation resolves the official UUID server-side;
all previous UUID-based write payloads remain accepted for compatibility.

Public match submissions are rejected. Only the authenticated admin match
endpoint can update results. Match idempotency keys, a per-kit database lock,
and a unique HT1-per-kit index protect ranked updates. The database schema is
created at startup; production migrations are a follow-up before schema changes
are deployed.

## Tests

```powershell
python -m pytest
```
